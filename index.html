                <p>Pyra Labs is a subsidiary of Google (Alphabet) that created the Blogger service in 1999. Google acquired Pyra Labs in 2003.The company's 
                first product, also named "Pyra", was a web application which would combine a project manager, contact manager, and to-do list. Their 
                coder Jack Dorsey altered an ftp program to work on a webpage, enabling online users to upload to a webpage web-log. In January 2001, 
                Pyra asked Blogger users for donations to buy a new server.[3] When the company's seed money dried up around the same time, the 
                employees continued without pay for weeks or, in some cases, months; but this could not last, and eventually Williams faced a mass 
                walk-out by everyone including co-founder Hourihan.

            announced a change in its publishing strategy and business model. The change is to its mix of paid journalists

                 Odeo was originally developed in 2005[1] by founders Noah Glass and Evan Williams, who were the founders of Audioblog and Pyra Labs, respectively, and 
                 received funding from Charles River Ventures. Subsequently, Williams bought out Charles River's interest in the company, as well as that of several other investors, 
                 and re-formed the organization under a new company, Obvious Corporation, which planned to develop new products, including Twitter.</p>
